title: GitHub Releases is where it's at
---

Apologies for the lack of updates. For a long time I seem to have
forgotten that this site existed. The last two major versions were
announced exclusively on
[github.com/stig/json-framework/releases](https://github.com/stig/json-framework/releases).

Not going to lie: this site is *woefully* out of date, and unless
someone steps in to update it it's going to stay that way. Your best
bet is heading to
[github.com/stig/json-framework](https://github.com/stig/json-framework)
rather than relying on this site.

PS: I'm no longer going to pay for the sbjson.org domain, so I've done
a minimal change to host this site from
[stig.github.io/json-framework](https://stig.github.io/json-framework)
instead.

*Update Ends.*
